## effective analysis
the problem here is that we use a magical number (0.001) as tolerance. The following analysis takes single-precision float as example, but same analysis can be performed on any float precision. Initial guess can be random, here we use 1.0 .
### very small numbers
If the radicand is a very small number, say 2e-38 (almost the smallest number single precision float can handle).
1. `(square 1.0) - 2e-38 = 1.0` or 1/1 > 0.001
  `(/ 2e-38 1.0) = 2e-38`
  `(average 1.0 2e-38) = 0.5` or 1/2
1. `(square 0.5) - 2e-38 = 0.25` or 1/4 > 0.001  
  `(/ 2e-38 0.5) = 4e-38`  
  `(average 0.5 4e-38) = 0.25` or 1/4
1. `(square 0.25) - 2e-38 = 0.0625` or 1/16 > 0.001  
   `(/ 2e-38 0.25) = 8e-38`  
   `(average 0.25 8e-38) = 0.125` or 1/8  
1. `(square 0.125) - 2e-38 = 0.015625` or 1/64 > 0.001
  `(/ 2e-38 0.125) = 1.6e-37`
  `(average 0.125 1.6e-37) = 0.0625` or 1/16
1. `(square 0.0625) - 2e-38 = 0.00390625` or 1/216 > 0.001
   `(/ 2e-38 0.0625) = 3.2e-37`
   `(average 0.0625 3.2e-37) = 0.03125` or 1/32
1. `(square 0.03125) - 2e-38 = 0.0009765625` or 1/1024 < 0.001

Now the iteration ends with a guess of 0.03125, or 3.125e-2. This is far from the actual square root, which is 1.4e-19. we can see that the interation will stop as soon as the guess reaches the same order of magnitude as the tolerance, which is arbitrary and have nothing to do with the actual square root we try to compute.
### very large numbers
If the radicand is a very large number, say 1e38 (almost the largest number single precision float can handle). 
1. `(square 1.0) - 1e38 = -1e38` > 0.001 //after abs
  `(/ 1e38 1.0) = 1e38`
  `(average 1.0 1e38) = 5e37` 
1. `(square 5e37) - 1e38 = 2.5e75` > 0.001
  `(/ 1e38 5e37) = 2.0`
  `(average 5e37 2.0) = 2.5e37` 
1. `(square 2.5e37) - 1e38 = 6.25e74` > 0.001
  `(/ 1e38 2.5e37) = 4.0`
  `(average 2.5e37 4.0) = 1.25e37` 
after roughly 63 iterations, we got a guess that`s roughly 1e19, let`s say 1.0001e19. however, the expression `((1e38/1.0001e19+1.0001e19)/2)^2-1e38` does not evaluate to 0, which is a number smaller than our tolerance 0.001, due to precision limit. It is more likely be evaluated to something like 1e+29, because the maximum number fraction part of a single-precision float number can represent is 2^23 which is 8388608. So what will happen is this iteration will go on forever since it would not be possible for the difference between `(square guess)` and `x` be smaller than 0.001.

## alternative implementation of good-enough?
```scheme
(define (good-enough? guess x)
  (< (abs (- (square guess) x)) (* x 0.001)))
```
### new square-root with alternative good-enough?
### effective analysis on very small number
the iteration will not stop at where `(square guess)` become smaller than 0.001, but continue until the difference between `(square guess)` and `x` is smaller than 1/1000 of x, which is the behaveior we want when putting "0.001" as tolerance.
### effective analysis on very large number
Since 1/1000 is definitely within the precision range where a digital computer can handle, the iteration will stop when the difference between `(square guess)` and `x` is smaller than 1/1000 of x.
