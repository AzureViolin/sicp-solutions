## case 1
```scheme
(+ 4 5)
(inc (+ (dec 4) 5))
(inc (inc (+ (dec 3) 5)))
(inc (inc (inc (+ dec(2) 5))))
(inc (inc (inc (inc (+ dec(1) 5)))))
(inc (inc (inc (inc (+ 0 5)))))
(inc (inc (inc (inc 5))))
(inc (inc (inc 6)))
(inc (inc 7))
(inc 8)
9
```
This is a recursive process, since the interpreter needs to know which step the process is in to be able to recover it from interrupt.
## case 2
```scheme
(+ 4 5)
(+ (dec 4) (inc 5))
(+ 3 6)
(+ 2 7)
(+ 1 8)
(+ 0 9)
9
```
This is a iterative process, since the interpreter can pick up the computation anywhere it left off by just looking at the values of the operands at that moment.
