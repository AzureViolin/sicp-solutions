assume we've already defined `abs` and `square` as in the previous text.
```scheme
(define (cube-root-iter guess x)
  (if (good-enough? guess x)
    guess
    (cube-root-iter (improve guess x) x)))

(define (improve guess x)
  (/ (+ (/ x 
           (square guess)) 
        (* 2 guess))
     3))

(define (good-enough? guess x)
  (< (abs (- (* guess 
                guess 
                guess) 
             x)) 
     (* x 0.001)))
```
when use, we do:
```scheme
(define (cube-root x)
  (cube-root-iter 1.0 x))
```
